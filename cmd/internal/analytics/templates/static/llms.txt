# Personal Reading Analytics - Project Overview

Zero-infrastructure reading analytics pipeline. Automated data pipeline via GitHub Actions with MongoDB event sourcing for observability and AI-powered Delta Analysis via Google Gemini.

## Candidate Profile
- **Developer:** Victoria Cheng (Software Developer)
- **Specialization:** Automation, Observability, Data Visualization.
- **Background:** Transitioned from physical engineering to software development, bringing a rigor for measurement and reliability (Prev at Shopify).
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/victoriacheng15

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Go (1.24+), Python (3.12+)
- **Pipeline:** GitHub Actions (CI/CD governance)
- **Data:** MongoDB Atlas (Event Sourcing), Google Sheets API
- **AI:** Google Gemini (Delta Analysis)

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **Zero Infrastructure:** No servers or hosting costs. Runs entirely on GitHub Actions and Pages, proving powerful automation doesn't require a budget.
- **Observability First:** Uses an Event Sourcing pattern with MongoDB to decouple extraction from analytics, ensuring full auditability and health monitoring.
- **Configuration-Driven Extraction:** Universal extractor pattern supporting multiple sources through structured configuration rather than hardcoded logic.
