# 🏗 Architectural Decisions

This directory contains the history of significant architectural shifts and technical decisions for the **Personal Reading Analytics Dashboard**. This project uses a combined ADR (Architecture Decision Record) and RFC (Request for Comments) approach to propose and record the "why" behind the technical evolution.

## 📋 Decision Log

## 🛠 Process

- **Propose:** Create a new Markdown file using the RFC template.
- **Accept:** Update the status to `Accepted` once a consensus is reached.
- **Supersede:** If a newer decision replaces an old one, update the old one's status to `Superseded`.
